",SampleID,Sample identification code,,,
"This is the sample metadata. There may be different types of sample metadata such as:
- Measured properties (e.g. moisture content, mass)
- Reported properties (e.g. ore type, lithology, location)
Note that for ""Reported properties"", a lab will only report back what they have received from a mining company.",P_SampleID,Parent sample identification ,,,

"Test | Parameters
",,,,,
"The test will have Parameters recorded when it is run. Parameters are the controlled input variables key to the test procedure that give context and meaning to the test results. The Parameters of interest will vary based on the type of test.
