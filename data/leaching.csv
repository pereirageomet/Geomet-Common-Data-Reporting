"This is the sample metadata. There may be different types of sample metadata such as:
- Measured properties (e.g. moisture content, mass)
- Reported properties (e.g. ore type, lithology, location)
Note that for ""Reported properties"", a lab will only report back what they have received from a mining company.",P_SampleID,ID Parent sample,,,
