Welcome to the Geometallurgy Data Reporting Guidelines repository.

This site provides a unified approach for collecting, structuring, and sharing geometallurgical data across mining projects. 
Our goal is to facilitate data comparison, improve transparency, and support reproducible geometallurgical modeling.
